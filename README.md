# DS-ML-Practice

This repository contains my **Data Science & Machine Learning practice projects** focused on building intuition and real problem-solving skills.

## 📂 Projects

### 🧪 Project 1 — Metric Stability & Statistical Intuition  
Location: [`project1/`](./project1)

This project explores how ML metrics like **Accuracy** and **RMSE** behave with different sample sizes, demonstrating core statistical ideas such as variability and reliability.


### Agentic Data Science Assistant (SID-ADSA)
Rule-based agent that autonomously performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), generates a report, and saves plots as reproducible artifacts.
